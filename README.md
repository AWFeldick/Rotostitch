## Rotostitch

A simple python/tkinter GUI utility to assist in assembling a cylindrical map of an object from a image sequence representing the object being rotated 360 degrees in uniform increments.

### Installation

Before you can use Rotostitch, you will need:

	1. Python 3 (developed with 3.4.2)
    2. Required dependencies (listed in requirements.txt)

To install Python 3 see [python.org](https://www.python.org/). After installing Python and cloning the Rotostitch repository (or downloading the ZIP), the next step is to install the dependencies.

To install the dependencies you can use Python pip and 'requirements.txt' to easily do so. On Windows, you could open an instance of 'cmd.exe' with admin privileges and run the following command (assuming you cloned/unzipped the app to the folder 'Rotostitch' that is located on your Desktop):

```bat
python -m pip install -r "C:\Users\[Your Username]\Desktop\Rotostitch\requirements.txt"
```
After the dependencies have been downloaded and installed, you can then run 'Rotostitch.pyw' to launch the program.

### Basic Usage

Check out the project's [Wiki](https://github.com/AWFeldick/Rotostitch/wiki) for documentation and tutorials! However, feel free to play around with the program without reading anything. It's pretty simple.
